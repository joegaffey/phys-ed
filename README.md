# Phys Ed

## What?

Basic 2D physics body editor.

## Why?

Use this tool to generate physics body shapes for 2D physics apps and games.  
Output format is based on [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) physics library.

## How?

Click to create points to represent the outline of your physics object.  
Trace the outline of an image with a transparent background for best effect.  
Preview the generated shape in action with the built-in test viewer.  

## Where?

Tool is running [here](https://phys-ed.glitch.me/).
