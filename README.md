## Why?

Use this tool to generate physics body shapes for 2D physics apps and games.  
Output format is based on [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) physics library.

## How?

Click to create points to represent the outline of your physics object.  
Trace the outline of an image with a transparent background for best effect.  
Preview the generated shape in action with the built-in test viewer.  

## Where?

Tool is running [here](https://phys-ed.glitch.me/).

## Who?

Just @joegaffey for now. All contributions appreciated. 

## When?

Basic prototype is [online](https://phys-ed.glitch.me/) now.  
Additional features and quality improvements depend on interest and personal needs including:
* Ability to move and delete points
* Image clipping
* Texture scale control
* Different physics engine output formats
* Separate test sandbox parameter controls
